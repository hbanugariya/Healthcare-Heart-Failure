# Heart Failure Survival Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of heart failure clinical data to identify factors influencing patient survival. Using Tableau, an interactive dashboard was developed to visualize survival outcomes based on demographics, clinical indicators, and comorbidities.

## Key Features
- **Survival Analysis:** Insights into survival and mortality rates among heart failure patients.
- **Clinical Indicators:** Correlations between survival outcomes and factors like age, serum creatinine, and ejection fraction.
- **Comorbidity Impact:** Evaluation of diabetes, anaemia, high blood pressure, and smoking on survival.

## Key Insights
1. Approximately **32%** of patients did not survive, underscoring the severity of heart failure.
2. **Older age** correlates with higher mortality (non-survivors: 65.2 years; survivors: 58.8 years).
3. **Higher serum creatinine** levels (1.84 mg/dL) and **lower ejection fraction** (33.5%) were prominent in non-survivors.
4. Targeted interventions for comorbidities like diabetes and anaemia can improve outcomes.

## How It Helps Organizations
- **Early Intervention:** Identify high-risk patients for timely medical care.
- **Resource Allocation:** Focus resources on demographics and risk factors driving mortality.
- **Strategic Insights:** Drive data-backed decisions to improve patient survival.

## Dataset
The dataset includes 299 patients with attributes like age, sex, clinical measurements, and survival outcomes. [Access the dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+failure+clinical+records).
